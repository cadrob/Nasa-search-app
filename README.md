#Personal Note

Please note - I am currently working on my graduation project at Northcoders for which I have 9 days to do it. This involves building a backend with Firebase/Express Server along with 2 front ends built in React and React Native. Time constraints are against me however I will do as much as I can within this test! Please see additional features and processes I would do/consider given more time:

- Use \_throttle from lo-dash and restrict results to perhaps 9 per scroll etc
- Loading spinner on all components where needed, not just asset.
- Use Cypress for testing, using stubbing for mock server etc
- Re-design so that searched results are still available upon going "back"
- User control on audio playback
- Error handling for API requests and bad navigation
- Ability to be more specific on search results (i.e Sort by year)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
